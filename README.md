# Movie_Recommendation_System
This repository contains the two recommender systems that are mostly used in industry. The first one predicts a binary outcome built with Restricted Boltzman Machine. Indeed, it predicts whether a user is going to like yes or no a movie. And the second one is built by an Autoencoder and it predicts the rating from 1 to 5 of a movie by a user.
